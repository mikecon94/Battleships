<h1 color="Red" align="center"> How to play </h1>
<b><u>Warships: Classic</u></b>
<p>Play the classic version of the game where each player has 5 ships and takes it in turns to try and locate their opponents ships before obliterating them off the board. The first player to wipe off out all of their opponents ships wins.</p>
<br>
<b><u>Warships: Reloaded</u></b>
<p>Both players play with 5 ships, but have the ability to set the grid size and whole host of ‘Power Ups’ available to them to seek and destroy their opponent quicker. Use these Power Ups wisely as you only get one of each and don’t want to waste them all at the start.</p>
<br>
